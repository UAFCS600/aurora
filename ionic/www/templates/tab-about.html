			<p>This application is under active development by the UAF Computer Science (UAF CS) seniors and is being overseen by the UAF Geophysical Institute (UAF GI). The purpose of this app is to act as a forecast/notification service for parties interested in the Aurora Borealis and its intensities at any given time.</p>
			<p>All data in this application are gathered from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) by the UAF GI for your convenience. The numbers being displayed are known as KP values, and are on a scale similar to that of the Richter scale.</p>
